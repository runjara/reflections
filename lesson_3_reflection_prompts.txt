When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on a team, sharing work for public revision, or mantaining a backup on the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because the remote can differ with the local repository and merging changes its not always automatic, conflicts may appear when many people is working on the same repository.
